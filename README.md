# LocalAccountManagement
The LocalAccountManagement module allows you to manage "local" user accounts from PowerShell.  This allows you to get, set, add, and remove users from local and remote computers.  It also allows you to remove local user profiles on local and remote computers.

## New Features
I will be adding new functions to manage user groups as well in the near future.
## Credit
Some of this code was borrowed from other online examples such as Ed Wilson's blog post
